## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 1, Part 1,

The very first lab was one of my favorites due to the excitement that followed with it being the very first lab I did as a Computer Science student. It taught the basics, but thats what was exciting about the lab. It was the stepping stone, and overall the start of my journey in my path as someone who wants to pursue a life in Computer Science. It involved the usage of our header #include iostream, creating our first main function, and creating a statement that has the output of "Hello Tuffy!". This is truly what captivated me as it gave me an insight of what my journey in this major would look like, and overall what my journey as a computer scientist will become.

Lab 7, Part 1, 

This was another one of my favorite labs because it felt like a shift from the basics into the difficulties, or struggles that it takes to create code for whats being asked for. We were tasked to write code to determine when it's allowed to park, using when it isn't allowed. In this lab, we implemented boolean which at an intro level it was a little difficult to understand. Despite the difficulties, I enjoyed this lab because of the results being able to give outputs when a person is allowed to park given the information of when they aren't allowed to park. Truly enjoyed it. 

Lab 10, Part 1, 

This was one of my favorite labs because it was a solo lab. This was during school break so it really gave me an insight of how difficult working alone is, and why peer work is a lot more convinent in terms of the field of computer science and what revolves around it. This lab specifically involved the task using 2D vectors which was something new that we were implementing. Just like in Lab 7, here again it was very difficult as it was something we learned with a grain of salt. However, this lab specifically used 2D Vectors to not only list the entirety counties of California, but also the populations in each. Which I find pretty awesome as the whole point of 2D vectors is to essentially create a table, and that's what was used to execute and list the counties and populations of California.
